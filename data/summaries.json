The current model—apps accessed through taps and swipes on touchscreens—will give way to something fundamentally different: an agentic system that responds to user intent rather than explicit commands.\n\nThis shift mirrors how computing platforms have evolved historically. Just as the web replaced desktop software and mobile apps replaced web browsing for many use cases, the next platform will be built around AI agents that understand context and execute complex tasks without users navigating through traditional app interfaces.\n\nThe implications are profound. Instead of opening specific apps to accomplish tasks, users will express their intent and AI systems will orchestrate the necessary actions across multiple services and platforms. This could make the current app store model—and the businesses built around it—as obsolete as CD-ROM software.",

Meta's approach with smart glasses exemplifies this philosophy—they're building devices that work with today's smartphones while laying the foundation for tomorrow's AR experiences.\n\nThis strategy acknowledges a crucial reality: revolutionary technologies rarely achieve mass adoption overnight. Users need time to adapt, and the technology needs time to mature. By creating products that provide immediate value while pointing toward future capabilities, companies can build user bases and iterate toward their ultimate vision.\n\nThe key is ensuring these bridge products aren't just tech demos—they must solve real problems for real people today.

When AI capabilities become commoditized, the differentiator shifts to having the best distribution, user relationships, and integration points. Meta's social platforms provide exactly those assets.\n\nThis approach also prevents any single company from controlling the foundational AI layer that future applications will depend on. For Meta, being locked out of the AI infrastructure layer by competitors like Google or OpenAI would be an existential threat to their ability to build compelling consumer experiences.",

When computing becomes ambient and context-aware, the entire notion of 'using' technology changes. Instead of pulling out a device and launching an app, technology becomes part of the background fabric of our daily lives.\n\nThe companies that win in this transition will be those that can successfully integrate advanced hardware capabilities with intuitive software experiences, creating products that feel magical rather than technical.",

The shift from desktop to web created Google and Amazon. The move to mobile created Instagram, Uber, and countless other companies. The transition to an AI-driven, post-mobile world will likely create similar opportunities.\n\nStartups entering this space should focus on building for the new paradigm rather than trying to incrementally improve existing solutions.

Crypto protocols can use tokens to incentivize early participants, creating value from day one.\n\nThis bootstrapping mechanism is particularly powerful when combined with AI infrastructure. Instead of a few large companies owning all the compute and data, crypto can coordinate distributed networks of participants who contribute resources and share in the upside.

Similarly, early internet content mimicked print before developing native formats like social feeds and viral media.\n\nAI is currently in its skeuomorphic phase, mostly automating existing workflows like writing emails or generating images in traditional styles.

Holterman and Rimann illuminate how broken processes - from botched referral handoffs to denied insurance claims that shouldn't be denied - create friction that ripples through the entire system.\n\nThe counterintuitive insight: healthcare's biggest lever for improvement isn't better medicine, it's better operations. When a referral gets lost between a primary care doctor and a specialist, or when a legitimate claim gets automatically denied due to a paperwork error, the downstream costs multiply exponentially. Patients delay care, providers burn hours on administrative work, and the system hemorrhages money that could be spent on actual healthcare.",

                "content": "In most tech products, 90% accuracy might be acceptable for a first version. In healthcare, it's a non-starter. Both founders emphasized that healthcare workflows demand reliability rates of 97% or higher because the stakes are so high - a failed process could mean delayed patient care or significant financial losses for providers.\n\nThis creates a unique product development challenge: you can't iterate your way to healthcare adoption the way you might with consumer apps. The initial product needs to work exceptionally well out of the gate, because healthcare providers won't tolerate unreliability when patient outcomes and revenue are on the line. It's a higher bar, but it also creates stronger defensibility once you clear it.",

Healthcare providers are drowning in new tools and software promises, but they'll only change their workflows if the incentives clearly align with their goals: saving time, reducing costs, or improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe founders stressed that successful healthcare startups don't just build better mousetraps; they restructure the cheese. Whether it's ensuring providers get paid faster for legitimate claims or reducing the administrative burden on referral processes, the technology serves the incentive alignment, not the other way around. This explains why many technically superior healthcare solutions fail while seemingly simpler ones with better incentive structures succeed.",

                "content": "In high-stakes healthcare workflows, trust becomes the most valuable currency and the strongest competitive moat. Once a healthcare provider trusts your system enough to integrate it into their critical workflows - especially around patient referrals or insurance claims - switching costs become enormous, not just in terms of money or time, but in terms of risk.\n\nThis creates a different dynamic than typical B2B software. Healthcare providers aren't just evaluating features or pricing; they're evaluating whether they can trust this system with processes that directly impact patient care and their financial survival. The founders noted that building this trust requires not just technical excellence, but deep understanding of healthcare operations and regulatory requirements.",

New York's proximity to major health systems, insurance companies, and healthcare decision-makers provides faster feedback loops and easier access to customers during the critical early stages.\n\nThe cultural differences matter too. New York's business culture - more direct, more focused on immediate value creation - aligns better with healthcare buyers who need to see clear ROI quickly. While Silicon Valley might be better for consumer apps that can afford longer adoption curves, healthcare infrastructure companies benefit from New York's emphasis on solving real business problems for paying customers from day one.",
