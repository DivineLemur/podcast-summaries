The current model—apps accessed through taps and swipes on touchscreens—will give way to something fundamentally different: an agentic system that responds to user intent rather than explicit commands.\n\nThis shift mirrors how computing platforms have evolved historically. Just as the web replaced desktop software and mobile apps replaced web browsing for many use cases, the next platform will be built around AI agents that understand context and execute complex tasks without users navigating through traditional app interfaces.\n\nThe implications are profound. Instead of opening specific apps to accomplish tasks, users will express their intent and AI systems will orchestrate the necessary actions across multiple services and platforms. This could make the current app store model—and the businesses built around it—as obsolete as CD-ROM software.",

Meta's approach with smart glasses exemplifies this philosophy—they're building devices that work with today's smartphones while laying the foundation for tomorrow's AR experiences.\n\nThis strategy acknowledges a crucial reality: revolutionary technologies rarely achieve mass adoption overnight. Users need time to adapt, and the technology needs time to mature. By creating products that provide immediate value while pointing toward future capabilities, companies can build user bases and iterate toward their ultimate vision.\n\nThe key is ensuring these bridge products aren't just tech demos—they must solve real problems for real people today.

When AI capabilities become commoditized, the differentiator shifts to having the best distribution, user relationships, and integration points. Meta's social platforms provide exactly those assets.\n\nThis approach also prevents any single company from controlling the foundational AI layer that future applications will depend on.

When computing becomes ambient and context-aware, the entire notion of 'using' technology changes. Instead of pulling out a device and launching an app, technology becomes part of the background fabric of our daily lives.\n\nThe companies that win in this transition will be those that can successfully integrate advanced hardware capabilities with intuitive software experiences, creating products that feel magical rather than technical.",

The shift from desktop to web created Google and Amazon. The move to mobile created Instagram, Uber, and countless other companies. The transition to an AI-driven, post-mobile world will likely create similar opportunities.\n\nStartups entering this space should focus on building for the new paradigm rather than trying to incrementally improve existing solutions.

Crypto protocols can use tokens to incentivize early participants, creating value from day one.\n\nThis bootstrapping mechanism is particularly powerful when combined with AI infrastructure. Instead of a few large companies owning all the compute and data, crypto can coordinate distributed networks of participants who contribute resources and share in the upside.

When a referral gets lost between a primary care doctor and a specialist, or when a legitimate claim gets automatically denied due to a paperwork error, the downstream costs multiply exponentially. Patients delay care, providers burn hours on administrative work, and the system hemorrhages money that could be spent on actual healthcare.",

The initial product needs to work exceptionally well out of the gate, because healthcare providers won't tolerate unreliability when patient outcomes and revenue are on the line.

Whether it's ensuring providers get paid faster for legitimate claims or reducing the administrative burden on referral processes, the technology serves the incentive alignment, not the other way around.

This isn't about building a simple product—it's about removing every possible friction point in the initial experience. For MongoDB, this meant ensuring developers could spin up a database instance and start querying data almost instantly, without configuration headaches or lengthy setup processes.\n\nThis principle fundamentally shaped MongoDB's product development philosophy. While traditional enterprise software companies focused on feature checklists and sales presentations, MongoDB obsessed over those critical first moments of developer interaction. The five-second rule became a forcing function for simplicity and immediate value delivery, which proved crucial in a world where developers increasingly drive technology adoption decisions within organizations.",

Instead, they focused on solving real problems developers faced, often with solutions that happened to involve MongoDB, but weren't explicitly sales-driven.\n\nThe genius was in the long-term compounding effect. Developers who attended these meetups became MongoDB advocates within their organizations, creating organic demand that would surface months or years later when those developers had decision-making authority. This created a pipeline of warm prospects who were already technically proficient with MongoDB before any enterprise sales conversation began. The meetup strategy also provided MongoDB with direct feedback loops from their core user base, informing product development in ways traditional market research couldn't.",

The key insight was that trying to convert every user into a paying customer was both impossible and counterproductive.

In a crowded automation space competing against Microsoft and Google, being memorable mattered more than being corporate.

This meant rebuilding their onboarding experience repeatedly, studying where users dropped off, and eliminating every possible point of friction. The self-serve model wasn't just about reducing costs; it was about speed to value.

This perspective shapes how they're rolling out AI across different asset classes.\n\nIn real estate, AI helps analyze market trends and property data at scale. In credit, it assists with risk assessment and document review. But Stecher emphasizes that AI outputs are treated as sophisticated research tools, not decision oracles. The analyst's role evolves from data gathering to hypothesis testing and strategic synthesis—arguably more valuable work than what they were doing before.",

Blackstone sees countless AI and fintech pitches, but the companies that get traction are those that demonstrate deep understanding of specific pain points in alternative asset management.\n\nHe looks for founders who have done their homework on Blackstone's business model, understand the regulatory environment they operate in, and can articulate why their solution is better than internal development. Generic demos don't work; customized proof-of-concepts that address real workflow challenges do. The best startup partnerships emerge when founders can speak the language of private equity, real estate, or credit—not just the language of technology.",

Twenty years ago, financial firms were primarily technology consumers, implementing systems built by others.

Firms that can build better technology to analyze markets, manage risk, and serve clients are pulling ahead of those that rely solely on traditional relationship-based approaches.

Karpoff pushes back against the common narrative that financial services lag in AI adoption. The reality is more nuanced: banks have been using machine learning for decades in fraud detection and risk management, but the recent wave of generative AI is accelerating deployment across customer service, compliance, and operational efficiency. The key difference is that banks can't afford to experiment publicly with half-baked AI products the way consumer tech companies can.\n\nThe real challenge isn't technical capability—it's regulatory compliance and risk management. Banks must demonstrate that AI decisions can be explained and audited, which creates a different adoption curve than other industries. This constraint actually forces more thoughtful implementation, leading to more sustainable AI integration rather than flashy demos.",

Karpoff explains how Citi used the crisis as justification for massive technology infrastructure investments that might have taken years to approve in normal times. The crisis highlighted the importance of real-time risk management and digital operational capabilities.\n\nThis created an unexpected opportunity: while smaller banks struggled with liquidity and regulatory scrutiny, large institutions like Citi could invest heavily in technology upgrades. The result is a widening technology gap between major banks and smaller institutions, fundamentally reshaping the competitive landscape. Banks that emerged from the crisis are now positioning themselves less as traditional financial institutions and more as technology companies that happen to be regulated like banks.",

Rather than acquiring startups or building everything in-house, Citi focuses on partnerships where startups handle customer-facing innovation while the bank provides regulatory expertise and infrastructure.\n\nKarpoff reveals that the most successful partnerships aren't about banks getting access to 'cool technology'—they're about startups getting access to regulatory knowledge and compliance infrastructure that would take them years and millions of dollars to build themselves. This creates a symbiotic relationship where startups can focus on product innovation while banks can experiment with new business models without the full regulatory burden of launching new products directly.",

Contrary to popular belief, the biggest challenge isn't bureaucracy—it's coordinating strategy across dozens of business lines that each generate billions in revenue and have their own priorities. His role involves less long-term visionary planning and more real-time coordination of competing strategic initiatives.\n\nThe key insight is that in organizations of Citi's scale, strategy is less about making big bets and more about ensuring that hundreds of smaller bets align with each other. This requires a different set of skills than traditional strategy consulting or startup planning. Success comes from building consensus across multiple stakeholders who each have valid but conflicting priorities, rather than from brilliant top-down strategic insights.",
